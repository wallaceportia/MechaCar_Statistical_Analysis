# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Overview

AutosRUs’ newest prototype, the MechaCar, is experiencing production troubles that is impeading the progress of the manufacturing team. AutosRUs’ upper management has called on Jeremy and the data analytics team to review the production data for insights that may help the manufacturing team.

* Identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
	
* Create summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots	

* Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population

Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
